When I was young I would @ADVERB learn all about them. Some are @ADVERB designed, not general purpose. My @ADJECTIVEest one has no @NOUN. We @ADVERB played @ADJECTIVE games on it because it does have a joystick to @VERB things. Soon @NOUNs had more memory so we could @ADVERB @VERB our own programs with @ADJECTIVE @NOUNs and the games were more complex. I will always @VERB @NOUNs even when I grow @ADJECTIVE! So next time you @VERB online, @ADVERB consider the nostalgia of @VERBing one of those old computers.",

"Well, that was @ADJECTIVE" I thought to myself and walked in the store. The store had rearranged it\'s inventory, so I felt @ADVERB lost. I walked up to store clerk and said @ADVERB, "I am looking for a @ADJECTIVE @NOUN that doesn\â€™t @VERB as often as the last one I had." The store clerk looked at me with a @ADJECTIVE look in his eye and said, "What you are looking for can be found by the @NOUN, if you see a @NOUN that @ADVERB can @VERB, then you\'ve gone too far." As I tried to understand his directions, I thought to myself, "I should have just ordered it on amazon.com; Their products seem to @VERB the perfect amount!"'};
